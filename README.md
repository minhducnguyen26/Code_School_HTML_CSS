# Code_School_HTML_CSS

Code School is an intensive nine-week course for students who are interested in jumpstarting their web programming careers. Interaction with the local industry is facilitated by Code School, and many participants are placed in internships and jobs within the software and web industries upon completing the course.

During the first week attending Code School, I had the opportunity to learn many advanced HTML5 and CSS skills, including flex-box and grid layout. Using those skills, I built a webpage for a restaurant and a mockup for my porfolio page.
